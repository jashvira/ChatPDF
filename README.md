# ChatPDF for Research Papers
An efficient retrieval mechanism to chat specifically with a technical
document using the OpenAI API. Embeddings of relevant snippets are created using the state-of-the-art (at that point) INSTRUCTOR model, followed by a dimensionality reduction using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). Finally, the embeddings are clustering into buckets of similar content using HDBSCAN. This system aims to solve hard problems like answering indirect query questions and looking up relevant references.
